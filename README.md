# Final-Project
Final Project for my SDEV 140 Class, Intro to Software Development

# What I have done
- Created the GUI
- Created all of the buttons and input fields to go into the GUI
- All of the buttons work except {Adv.} and {DisAdv.}
- The main functions of the application works
- Put everything into object-orientated programming

# What I need help with
Nothing right now, everything is going pretty smoothly

# What my next step is
- Making the Adv. and DisAdv. buttons work.
